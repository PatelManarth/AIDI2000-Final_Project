# AIDI2000-Final_Project: Diabetes Prediction Using LSTM Model

## Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of diabetes using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The application includes a Flask-based REST API for serving predictions and a Streamlit front end for user interaction. The model evaluation achieved a high accuracy of 97%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the LSTM model in predicting diabetes based on patient data.
